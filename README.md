# Math Engine

This is a math engine containing classes for vectors (2D and 3D), matrix (3x3) and quaternions.

## Vector (2D and 3D)

- addition/subtraction
- scalar multiplication/division
- dot product
- cross product
- magnitude
- normalisation
- rotation

## Matrix (3x3)

- addition/subtraction
- scalar multiplication/division
- product
- vector multiplication
- inverse
- transpose

## Quaternion

- addition/subtraction
- scalar multiplication/division
- product
- norm
- normalisation
- conjugate
- inverse
